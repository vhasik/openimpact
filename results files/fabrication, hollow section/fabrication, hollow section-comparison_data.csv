These tubes are generally used for structural and maintenance purposes, such as the construction of buildings, railings and sign posts. Carbon steel has many interesting properties, it is especially valued for its use in heavy structures and / or that require resistance to corrosion and extreme temperatures, such as the construction of both houses and large structures, such as bridges, roads or oil plants. It is easy to weld, and to cut, square or rectangular tubes are easier to mold and moderate machining can be done, since it is a very dense material.

The strip is de-coiled and after surface preparation, it is cut to an appropriate width, formed by bending to a round, square or rectangular shape and then welded longitudinally. The shaping operation can be performed either cold or on strip which has been heated. The procedure is carried out in a continuous line, the final operation being cutting to length. Hot-formed profiles have lower internal stresses than cold-formed which means that there is less risk for shape changes if they are cut, machined or welded. The principal advantages of cold-formed profiles are better dimensional tolerances and surface finish. Hollow profiles, especially those with square or rectangular section, are used as a complement to beam profiles in building construction and civil engineering. Compared with H- and I-beam profiles and U-channels, the closed shape of hollow profiles means that, for a given cross-sectional area, they have much better resistance to twisting. The steel grades used for cold- and hot-formed hollow profiles are most often weldable, low-carbon constructional steels with an iron content of 98% or more. As with other steel products, hollow profiles used in building and civil engineering constructions can at the end of their useful life be recovered and recycled to 100%.",1 kg,2.6,kgCO2e,,kgSO2,,kgN,,kgCFC11,,kgO3,TRACI 2.1,Product EPDs,Sweden,2025
