Masonry >> Concrete Unit Masonry,Boehmers,"Kitchener, ON",Light-Weight Concrete Masonry Units,"Carboclave CMU is a next-generation, patent-pending masonry product that utilizes recovered carbon dioxide as a curing agent in lieu of typical steam curing. Molded blocks are loaded into Boehmers’ autoclave and pressurized with CO2 (typically 10 psi). The CO2 causes the carbonation reaction to occur, which produces calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the concrete. As CO2 is consumed, the pressure in the autoclave reduces to 0 psi and the process is repeated multiple times until the blocks are fully cured. Since converting operations form autoclave steam curing to Carboclave, Boehmers has eliminated their use of energy for curing and now sequester a minimum of 0.5 lbs (0.227 kg) CO2 into each 20 cm block produced.",1 m3,256,0.210475652,300.1059766,cqd.io/e/ec38nc66ss,1/7/2024,ASTM International: Manufactured Concrete and Concrete Masonry Products,cqd.io/p/ec3p875zcu,Product EPDs,CA,,"Boehmers | Kitchener, ON | Light-Weight Concrete Masonry Units"
